The Global Car Safety Organisation tests cars for safety and reliability in the event of a
crash.Based upon the weight and speed of the car, the deformation of the car is calculated.
Any deformation greater than 180 is considered lethal for the passengers.
● Any deformation between 80 and 180 is considered average.
● Deformation below 80 is considered good.
